## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: N-ary arithmetic operators

The arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, and `*` SHALL accept any number of arguments and
evaluate to the same result as the left-folded binary application, with the standard
identities: `(+)` = 0, `(*)` = 1, `(- a)` = negation of `a`. `(-)` with no arguments is a
compile-time error. This SHALL be a frontend expansion into binary primitive calls, with
no change to the runtime or the emitted calling convention.

#### Scenario: N-ary sum and product

- **WHEN** a program evaluates `(+ 1 2 3 4)` and `(* 2 3 4)`
- **THEN** the results are `10` and `24`

#### Scenario: Left-associative subtraction and unary negation

- **WHEN** a program evaluates `(- 10 1 2)` and `(- 5)`
- **THEN** the results are `7` and `-5`

#### Scenario: Identities

- **WHEN** a program evaluates `(+)` and `(*)`
- **THEN** the results are `0` and `1`
