## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Typed binding resolution

Free-identifier resolution SHALL classify every resolved binding by a kind — `local` (the
current unit's own top-level definition), `imported` (another unit's export), or `primitive`
(a built-in operator/keyword) — resolving lexical locals first, then the unit's own
top-level definitions, then imported bindings, then primitives, and otherwise reporting an
unbound-variable error. In this change no imported bindings exist yet; the resolution
results for any program that imports no library SHALL be identical to the prior flat model.

#### Scenario: A program's own top-level define resolves as local

- **WHEN** a program references a name it defines at top level
- **THEN** resolution classifies the binding as `local`
- **AND** the emitted reference targets the same global the flat model produced

#### Scenario: A primitive resolves as primitive

- **WHEN** a program references a built-in operator or keyword (e.g. `car`, `if`)
- **THEN** resolution classifies it as `primitive` and emits the same intrinsic as before

#### Scenario: An unbound identifier still errors

- **WHEN** a program references a name that is neither local, imported, nor primitive
- **THEN** resolution reports an unbound-variable error, as it did before

### Requirement: Deterministic module-qualified symbol naming

The compiler SHALL name a compilation unit's own emitted symbols — top-level globals and
lifted code-block labels — through a deterministic, unit-parameterized function. For a
library named `(p₁ p₂ … pₙ)` and an internal name `x`, the function SHALL produce the symbol
`p₁.p₂.….pₙ:x`, a pure function of the library name and the internal name with no dependence
on compile order or counters. The **program** (non-library) unit SHALL use the empty prefix,
so its emitted symbol names are unchanged from today.

#### Scenario: Library name maps to a canonical symbol

- **WHEN** the naming function is applied to library `(scheme base)` and internal name `map`
- **THEN** it returns the symbol string `scheme.base:map`

#### Scenario: The same input always yields the same symbol

- **WHEN** the naming function is applied twice to the same `(library, name)` pair, in
  separate compilations
- **THEN** it returns the identical symbol both times (no counter or order dependence)

#### Scenario: Program-unit symbols are unprefixed

- **WHEN** a lifted code block or top-level global is emitted for the program unit (no
  enclosing library)
- **THEN** its symbol name is exactly what the pre-change compiler emitted (empty prefix)

### Requirement: Scaffolding preserves emitted IR

Introducing the typed-scope resolver and the unit-parameterized naming SHALL NOT change the
LLVM IR emitted for any program that imports no library. The compiler's own regenerated IR
(`bootstrap/*.ll`) SHALL remain a stable self-hosting fixed point after the change.

#### Scenario: Library-free programs emit byte-identical IR

- **WHEN** any existing demo/program (which imports no library) is compiled before and after
  this change
- **THEN** the emitted `.ll` is byte-for-byte identical

#### Scenario: Existing suites and the trust-check pass

- **WHEN** `run-all-tests.sh` and `run-dev-tests.sh` are run after `make regen`
- **THEN** all suites pass, including self-emission-equivalence and the anti-stale
  trust-check (regenerated committed IR is reproduced byte-for-byte from source)
