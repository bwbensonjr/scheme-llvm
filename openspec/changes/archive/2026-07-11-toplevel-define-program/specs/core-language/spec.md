## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Compile and run the M1 core-lambda subset

The compiler SHALL accept a **program consisting of a sequence of one or more top-level
forms** over the M1 core subset — fixnums, booleans, the empty list, and pairs; the
forms `quote`, `if`, `lambda`, application, `let`, `letrec`, `begin`, `set!`, and
top-level `define` (both `(define x e)` and the `(define (f arg ...) body ...)` lambda
shorthand); and the primitives `+ - * = <`, `cons`, `car`, `cdr`, `null?`, `pair?`,
`eq?` — and compile it to a native executable that computes the program's value. The
**value of a program is the value of its last top-level expression**; a program of a
single expression (the M1 case) is the one-form instance of this rule.

#### Scenario: Recursive arithmetic

- **WHEN** a tail-recursive `fact`-style program over fixnums, `if`, `letrec`, and
  arithmetic primitives is compiled and run
- **THEN** the executable produces the mathematically correct result

#### Scenario: Allocation and pairs

- **WHEN** a program builds and traverses a list via `cons`, `car`, `cdr`, and `null?`
- **THEN** the executable produces the correct result, with pairs heap-allocated under
  Boehm GC

#### Scenario: Assignment

- **WHEN** a program uses `set!` on a captured variable (exercising assignment
  conversion)
- **THEN** the executable produces the correct result and no `set!` survives into the
  emitted IR

#### Scenario: Multi-form program with top-level define

- **WHEN** a program of several top-level forms — top-level `define`s (including the
  `(define (f arg ...) ...)` procedure shorthand) that refer to one another, followed by
  a trailing expression — is compiled and run
- **THEN** the executable produces the value of the last top-level expression, with the
  definitions mutually visible (as under `letrec`)

#### Scenario: Single-expression program still valid

- **WHEN** a program consisting of exactly one top-level expression (no `define`) is
  compiled and run
- **THEN** the executable produces that expression's value, matching M1 behavior
